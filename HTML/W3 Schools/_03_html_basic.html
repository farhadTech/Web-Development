HTML documents
All HTML documents must start with a document type declaration: <!DOCTYPE html>.
The HTML document itself begins with <html> and ends with </html>
The visible part of the HTML document is between <body> and </body>

Example
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <body>
        <h1>My first heading</h1>
        <p> My first paragraph.</p>
    </body>
</html>

The <!DOCTYPE> declaration
The <!DOCTYPE declaration represents the document type, and helps browsers to display web pages correctly.

It must only appear once, at the top of the page(before any HTML tags).
The <!DOCTYPE> declaration is not case sensitive
The <!DOCTYPE> declaration for HTML5 isp:

<!DOCTYPE html>
