What is an HTML elements?
An HTML element is defined by a start tag, some content, and an end tag:

<tagname> Content goes here...</tagname>
The HTML element is everything from the start tag to the end tag:
<h1> My First Heading</h1>
<p> My first paragraph</p>

start tag           element content         End tag
<h1>                My First Heading        </h1>
<p>                 My first paragraph      </p>
<br>                None                    None

Note: Some HTML elements have no content (like the <br> element). These elements are called empty elements. Empty elements do not have an end tag!

Web browsers
The purpose of a web browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari) is to read HTML documents and display them correctly.

A browser does not display the HTML tags, but uses them to determine how to display the document:
