An HTML element is defined by a start tag, some contenet, and an end tag.
The HTML element is everything from the start tag to the end tag:
<tagname> Content goes here...</tagname>

Examples of some HTML elements:
<h1>My first heading</h1>
<p>My first paragraph.</p>

start tag           element Content             end tag
<h1>                My first heading            </h1>
<p>                 My first paragraph          </p>
<br>                none                        none

Note: Some HTML elements have no content (like the <br> element). These elements are called empty elements. Empty elements do not have an end tag!

Nested HTML elements
HTML elements can be nested (this means that elements can contain other elements).
All HTML documents consists of nested HTML elements.
The following example contains four HTML elements (<html></html>, <body></body> <h1></h1>, and <p></p>):

Example

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <body>

        <h1>
            My first heading
        </h1>

        <p>
            My first paragraph.
        </p>

    </body>
</html>

Example explained
The <html> element is the root element and it defines the whole HTML document.
I has a start tag <html> and an end tag </html>

Then inside the <html> element there is a <body>element</body></html>:

<body>
    <h1> My first heading</h1>
    <p> My first paragraph.</p>
</body>

The <body> element defines the document's body. It has a start tag <body> element there are two other elements: <h1></h1> and <p></p> </body>

<h1> MY first heading</h1>
<p> My first paragraph</p>

The <h1> element defines a heading</h1>
It has a start tag <h1> and an end tag</h1>

<h1>My first heading.</h1>

The <p>element defines a paragraph</p>
It has a start tag <p> and an end tag</p>

<p> My first paragraph</p>

Never skip the end tag
Some HTML elements will display correctly, even if you forget the end tag:

Example
<html>
    <body>
        <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
        <p>This is another paragraph</p>
    </body>
</html>

Empty HTML elements:
HTML elements with no content are called empty elements.
The <br> tag defines a line break, and is an empty element without a closing tag:

Example:
<p>This is a <br> paragraph with a line break.</p>

HTML is not case sensitive
HTML tags are not case sensitive: <p> means the same as</p>
The HTML standard does not require lowercase tags, but it is better to write in lowercase letters.
