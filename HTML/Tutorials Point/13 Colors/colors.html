HTML Colors are a way of specifying the appearance of web elements. Colors are very important aspects of web design, as they not only enhance the visual appeal but also influence user behavior. They are also used to evoke emotions and highlight important content.

In HTML, colors are generally used to color backgrounds, borders and texts.

HTML Color Coding Methods:
* Color Names: We can specify color names directly like green, blue or red.
* HEX Color Codes: A six-digit code representing the amount of red, green and blue that makes up the color.
* RGB Color Values: This value is specified using the rgb() property.
