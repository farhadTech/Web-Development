<!-- CSS or Cascading Style Sheets is a tool that defines how web documents look on screens or in print. Since its introduction in 1994, the w3c has encouraged the use of style sheets for web design. CSS lets you control the presentation of your content, whether it's on a screen, in print, or for accessibility, making web design more flexible and efficient.

Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) provide easy and effective alternatives to specify various attributes for the HTML tags. Using CSS, you can specify a number of style properties for a given HTML element.

Each property has a name and a value, separated by a colon (:). Each property declaration is separated by a semi-color(;). -->
