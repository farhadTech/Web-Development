What are HTML Comments?
HTML comment tag is used to create a comment. A comment in HTML is like a note for yourself and others. Comments are completely ignored by web browsers, so they don't affect how your page looks or works. There are two types of comments in HTML.

* Single line comment: The single-line comment is given inside the <!--...-->
* Multi line comment: Same as single-line comment but if we add multiple lines in the comment we will have multi-line comments.

Why to use HTML Comments?
Comments help you and others to understand the code and increase code readability. HTML Comments are placed in between <!--...--> tags. So, any content placed with-in <!--...--> tags will be treated as comment and will be completely ignored by the browser.
