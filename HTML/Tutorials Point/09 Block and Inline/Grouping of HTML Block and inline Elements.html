<!--
There are two ways to group these elements
Using <div> Tag
Using <span> Tag
-->

<!--
Grouping using <div> Tag
The <div> tag is a block level element which plays a big role in grouping various other HTML tags and applying CSS on group elements. Even now <div> tag can be used to create webpage layout where we define different parts (left, right, top etc.) of the web page. This tag does not provide any visual change on the block but this has more meaning when it is used with CSS.

Following is a simple example of <div> tag. We will learn Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) in a separate chapter but we used it here to show the usage of <div> tag-
-->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>HTML div Tag</title>
</head>
<body>
    <!-- First group of tags-->
    <div style = "color: red">
        <h4>This is first group</h4>
        <p>Following is a list of vegetables.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Beetroot</li>
            <li>Ginger</li>
            <li>Potato</li>
            <li>Radish</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <!-- Second group of tags-->
    <div style = "color: green">
        <h4>This is second group</h4>
        <p>Following is a list of fruits.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Apple</li>
            <li>Banana</li>
            <li>Mango</li>
            <li>Strawberry</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
</body>
</html>


<!--
Grouping using <span> tag
The HTML <span> is an inline element and it can be used to group inline-elements in an HTML document. This tag also does not provide any visual change on the block but has more meaning when it used with CSS.

The difference between the <span> tag and the <div> tag is that the <span> tag is used with inline elements whereas the <div> tag is used with block-level elements.

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>HTML span Tag</title>
</head>
<body>
    <p>
        This is <span style = "color: red">red</span>
        and this is <span style = "color: green">green</span>
    </p>
</body>
</html>
