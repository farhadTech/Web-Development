<!-- Horizontal lines are used to visually break-up sections of a document. The <hr> tag creates a line from the current position in the document to the right margin and breaks the line accordingly. The <hr/> tag is an example of the empty element, where you do not need opening and closing tags, as there is nothing to in between them.

Following example draws a horizontal line between two paragraphs. On executing the code, you can see a straight line dividing the two paragraphs.-->
