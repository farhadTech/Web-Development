<!--
Only the empty elements like <hr> and <br> do not require closing tags, other elements such as <p> and <h1> do. Failing to include closing tags for these elements may not result in an error, and some content may still display properly. However, never miss the closing tag as it may lead to unexpected and inconsistent results.

    <body>
        <p>
            This line contains a line break tag,
            <br> hence content is visible in two separate lines.
        </p>
        This line is <hr> separated by a horizontal rule.
