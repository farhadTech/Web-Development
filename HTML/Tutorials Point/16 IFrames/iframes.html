An iframe is an inline frame that allows us to embed another document within the current HTML document. In HTML, the inline frame is defined with the <iframe></iframe> tag. This tag creates a rectangular region at specified place within the HTML document in which the browser can display an external document such as a map or another web page.

Syntax:
<iframe src="url" title="description"></iframe>

URL or path of the external document is attached using the src attribute of <iframe></iframe> tag. If the current of iframe exceeds the specified rectangular region, HTML automatically includes the scrollbars. HTML allows any number of iframes, but it may affect the performance of the website. Always include a title attribute for the <iframe></iframe> that will help screen reader to read out what is the content provided in the iframe.
