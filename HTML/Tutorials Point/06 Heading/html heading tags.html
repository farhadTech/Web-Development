HTML Heading is created by using <h1></h1> to <h6></h6> tags. The heading hierarchy determines the importance of content and aids in creating a clear information flow for both users and search engines.

Hierarchical Structure of Heading Tags:
Below is the list according to the hierarchy of the heading tags (most to least significant).

* HTML <h1></h1> Tag: The top-level heading denotes the main topic or title of the entire page.
* HTML <h2></h2> Tag:  Subheadings under <h1></h1> represents major sections related to the main topic. They provide a more specific context to the content.
* HTML <h3></h3> to <h6></h6> Tags: These tags are used for further subsections or nested content within <h2></h2> headings. They offer a deeper level of hierarchy for organizing content within specific sections.


Mistakes to be avoided

* Skipping Levelas: Always follow the proper hierarchy (h1, h2, h3, etc.) don't skip levels.
* Overusing h1: Reserve h1 for the main title; don't use it multiple times on a page.
* Styling Overload: Avoid excessive styling; CSS should handle the aesthetics, not headings.
