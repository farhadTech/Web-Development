<!--
Tables can be divided into three portions: a header, a body, and a foot. The head and foot are rather similar to headers and footers in a word-processed document that remain the same for every page, while the body is the main content holder of the table.

The three elements for separation the head, body, and foot of a table are -

* The <thead> tag to create a separate table header.
* The <tbody> tag to indicate the main body of the table.
* The <tfoot> tag to create a separate table footer.
